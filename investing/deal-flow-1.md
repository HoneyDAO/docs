# Deal Flow:

* Dealer reaches out to potential partnerships to see if there is possibility for collaboration. General terms may be negotiated at this point.
* If the dealer recognizes said deal as a good fit for the DAO, they bring it to the rest of the bees for discussion & research. Discussion will happen within the private discord community & the HoneyDAO forum.
* If the overall sentiment is positive amongst the Bees, the founder and team will be brought into the private hive and will be able to access an AMA channel specifically for that partnership/project.
* A pledge form will then be opened, where bees will have an opportunity to commit a monetary amount to the project, as well as how they are willing to assist the project(community management, beta testing, writing threads/articles, code review, etc.) The funds will then be collected into a multisig and then deployed to the appropriate contract.
* The deal is then closed and the work continues.

#### Project Assessment:

All members of the DAO will vet out a given project via discord (qualitative/quantitative) and initially discuss the pros and cons to determine if the given project is suitable for collaboration.

#### Hive Post:

Once an assessment has been conducted, a thread on the Hive forum is created where Bees can discuss the project in further depth and detail.

#### AMA:

The DAO then requests the given teamâ€™s project members permission to collaborate and follow up with an AMA in the Honey DAO discord. The DAO members can then ask any questions from the founders and team and discuss the project..

#### Snapshot Voting:

Following the AMA, Honey DAO conducts a sentiment check via a snapshot vote. Each snapshot will provide an overview of the protocol/team.

#### Pledge Form:

Once the DAO has reached a general consensus via snapshot voting, each Bee is required to fill out a pledge form indicating how much they are willing to contribute, how they can help the team, and any other relevant comments/concerns.

#### Funding:

Immediately after the pledge form closes, the DAO allocates funds from pledged contributors to a multisig (Gnosis) & finalizes the details of the deal with the respective partner.
